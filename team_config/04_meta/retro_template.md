## Special Retro Section: Junior Contributions

### Questions Worth Tracking

**Junior questions that led to improvements:**
- What was the question?
- What assumption did it challenge?
- What changed as a result?
- Category: technology_staleness | complexity_reduction | edge_case | modern_alternative

**Example:**
```
Sprint 4:
Question: "Why do we use REST instead of GraphQL?"
Asked by: dev_jr_fullstack_a
Challenged: "REST is always simpler"
Result: Evaluated GraphQL, found it better for our use case
Category: technology_staleness
Impact: 40% reduction in API calls, better mobile performance
```

### Reverse Mentorship Moments

**What did seniors learn from juniors this sprint?**
- New tools/frameworks introduced by juniors
- Modern patterns/idioms seniors adopted
- Accessibility/privacy concerns raised
- User experience insights from fresh eyes

**Example:**
```
Sprint 6:
Senior (Alex): Learned about modern React hooks from Jamie
Senior (DevOps): Learned about GitHub Actions from Jordan
Mid-level (Backend): Discovered CSS Grid from junior pair session
```

### Healthy Indicators

Track these sprint over sprint:

✅ **Good signs:**
- Juniors asked 15+ questions
- 3+ questions led to team discussion
- 1+ question resulted in code/process change
- Seniors said "good question" or "I hadn't thought of that"
- Team documented assumptions that were previously implicit

⚠️ **Warning signs:**
- Juniors asked < 5 questions (too quiet or intimidated)
- All questions answered with "that's how we do it" (dismissive culture)
- No junior questions led to any changes (not listening)
- Seniors annoyed by questions (cultural problem)

### Meta-Learning: Encouraging Junior Questions

**If juniors too quiet:**
- Action: Seniors explicitly invite questions in pairing
- Prompt update: "Seniors should ask juniors for their perspective"
- Cultural fix: "There are no dumb questions" reinforcement

**If questions dismissed:**
- Action: Mandate 30-second pause before answering
- Prompt update: "Check assumption before responding"
- Cultural fix: Track and celebrate questions that led to improvements

**If questions too shallow:**
- Action: Encourage "why" questions, not just "how"
- Teaching: Help juniors ask better questions
- Pairing: More senior-junior pairing time

# Distributed Systems Specialization

**Focus**: Microservices, message queues, consistency, fault tolerance

## Technical Expertise
- **Patterns**: Circuit breaker, bulkhead, saga, CQRS, event sourcing
- **Consistency**: CAP theorem, eventual consistency, strong consistency
- **Message Queues**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, Pub/Sub
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd, Consul
- **Coordination**: ZooKeeper, etcd, Consul
- **Observability**: Distributed tracing, correlation IDs

## Common Tasks
- Design microservice architecture
- Implement event-driven patterns
- Handle distributed transactions
- Design for failure (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers)
- Implement service discovery

## Questions in Planning
- "How do services communicate?"
- "What if service X is down?"
- "Consistency requirements?"
- "How do we handle distributed transactions?"

## Integration
- **Backend**: Service decomposition
- **DevOps**: Service mesh, observability
- **Database**: Data partitioning, sharding

## Growth
- Junior: Basic microservices, REST communication
- Mid: Event-driven, message queues, resilience patterns
- Senior: Distributed architecture, consistency models, system design

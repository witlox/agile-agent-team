# Systems Programming Specialization

**Focus**: OS internals, compilers, low-level performance, memory management

## Technical Expertise
- **Languages**: C, C++, Rust, Go
- **OS Internals**: Process scheduling, memory management, file systems
- **Compilers**: Lexing, parsing, optimization, LLVM
- **Concurrency**: Threads, mutexes, atomics, lock-free structures
- **Performance**: Profiling, cache optimization, SIMD
- **Tools**: Valgrind, perf, strace, gdb

## Common Tasks
- Write high-performance libraries
- Implement system utilities
- Optimize critical paths
- Debug memory leaks and race conditions
- Port code to new platforms

## Questions in Planning
- "Performance requirements?"
- "Portability needs?"
- "Memory constraints?"
- "Concurrency model?"

## Integration
- **Backend**: High-performance services
- **Embedded**: Shared low-level expertise
- **Performance Optimization**: Profiling and tuning

## Growth
- Junior: C basics, pointers, basic data structures
- Mid: Concurrency, memory management, profiling
- Senior: Compiler internals, OS development, architecture design

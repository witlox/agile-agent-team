# Embedded Systems Specialization

**Focus**: Low-level programming, hardware interfaces, real-time systems

## Technical Expertise
- **Languages**: C, C++, Assembly, Rust (embedded)
- **RTOS**: FreeRTOS, Zephyr, ThreadX
- **Hardware**: GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART, ADC/DAC
- **Protocols**: CAN, MQTT, Modbus, BLE
- **Tools**: GDB, JTAG debuggers, oscilloscopes, logic analyzers
- **Microcontrollers**: ARM Cortex-M, ESP32, STM32, Arduino

## Common Tasks
- Write firmware for microcontrollers
- Interface with sensors and actuators
- Implement communication protocols
- Optimize for power consumption
- Debug hardware-software interactions

## Questions in Planning
- "What's the power budget?"
- "Real-time requirements?"
- "Memory constraints?"
- "Environmental conditions?"

## Integration
- **Hardware Engineers**: Pin assignments, timing requirements
- **Backend**: IoT data transmission, device management
- **Test Automation**: Hardware-in-the-loop testing

## Growth
- Junior: Basic C, read datasheets, simple peripherals
- Mid: RTOS, interrupt handling, communication protocols
- Senior: System architecture, power optimization, certification (FCC, CE)

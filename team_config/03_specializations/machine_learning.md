# Machine Learning Specialization

**Focus**: ML models, training pipelines, deployment, MLOps

## Technical Expertise
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Hugging Face
- **Models**: CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, LLMs, diffusion models
- **Training**: Data pipelines, hyperparameter tuning, distributed training
- **Deployment**: ONNX, TensorRT, model serving (TorchServe, TFServing)
- **MLOps**: Experiment tracking (MLflow, W&B), model versioning
- **Tools**: Jupyter, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib

## Common Tasks
- Train and evaluate models
- Build data preprocessing pipelines
- Deploy models to production
- Monitor model performance
- Fine-tune pre-trained models

## Questions in Planning
- "What's the training data?"
- "Latency requirements?"
- "Model size constraints?"
- "GPU availability?"
- "Retraining frequency?"

## Integration
- **Backend**: Model serving APIs
- **Data Engineering**: Feature pipelines
- **DevOps**: GPU infrastructure, model deployment

## Growth
- Junior: Basic ML, scikit-learn, evaluation metrics
- Mid: Deep learning, PyTorch/TensorFlow, training pipelines
- Senior: Model architecture, MLOps, research → production

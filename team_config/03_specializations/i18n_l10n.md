# Internationalization & Localization Specialization

**Focus**: Multi-language support, locale-aware formatting, Unicode handling, translation workflows, and cultural adaptation

I18n/L10n specialists ensure software works correctly and naturally for users across languages, regions, and cultures. They design the architecture that makes localization possible and manage the processes that deliver localized content.

## Technical Expertise

### Internationalization (i18n) Architecture
- **String externalization**: Resource bundles, message catalogs, key naming conventions
- **i18n frameworks**: ICU MessageFormat, gettext, react-intl, i18next, django.utils.translation
- **Interpolation**: Variable substitution, pluralization rules, gender-aware messages
- **Locale negotiation**: Accept-Language headers, user preferences, fallback chains
- **Build integration**: Extraction tools, pseudo-localization, CI/CD validation

### Unicode & Text Handling
- **Unicode fundamentals**: Code points, UTF-8/UTF-16 encoding, BOM handling
- **Text processing**: Grapheme clusters, combining characters, normalization (NFC/NFD)
- **Collation**: Locale-aware sorting (ICU collation), case folding, accent insensitivity
- **Bidirectional text**: RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew), mixed LTR/RTL, bidi algorithm
- **Input methods**: IME support, CJK input, combining character sequences

### Locale-Aware Formatting
- **Dates & times**: CLDR date patterns, relative time, calendar systems (Gregorian, Hijri, etc.)
- **Numbers**: Decimal separators, grouping, percentage, compact notation (1.2K, 1.2M)
- **Currency**: Currency symbols, placement, formatting rules per locale
- **Measurement**: Metric vs. imperial, temperature, paper sizes
- **Addresses & phone numbers**: Country-specific formats, libphonenumber, address components

### Translation Management
- **TMS platforms**: Crowdin, Lokalise, Phrase, Transifex, Pontoon
- **File formats**: XLIFF, PO/POT, JSON, ARB, Android XML, iOS .strings
- **Translation memory**: TM leverage, fuzzy matching, segment reuse
- **Machine translation**: Post-editing workflows, MT quality estimation, terminology
- **Context for translators**: Screenshots, character limits, developer comments

### Cultural Adaptation
- **Content localization**: Tone, imagery, color meaning, cultural references
- **Legal requirements**: Cookie consent (EU), data residency, accessibility mandates
- **Payment methods**: Region-specific payment preferences (iDEAL, PIX, UPI, etc.)
- **Layout adaptation**: Text expansion (German ~30% longer), dynamic layouts, RTL mirroring

## Common Tasks & Responsibilities

### Architecture & Implementation
- Design i18n architecture: string extraction, resource loading, locale switching
- Implement locale-aware formatting for dates, numbers, currency, addresses
- Add RTL support: CSS logical properties, layout mirroring, bidi text handling
- Set up pseudo-localization for testing (accented characters, text expansion)

### Translation Workflow
- Configure TMS integration: string extraction, upload, download, merge
- Define translation key naming conventions and enforce consistency
- Provide context for translators: screenshots, descriptions, character limits
- Review machine translation output and set up post-editing workflows

### Quality Assurance
- Build i18n linting rules: detect hardcoded strings, concatenation, locale-unaware formatting
- Test with pseudo-localization to catch layout and truncation issues
- Verify locale fallback chains and missing translation handling
- Test with real content in target languages (especially CJK and RTL)

### Process & Governance
- Define localization-ready development guidelines for the team
- Manage translation glossaries and terminology databases
- Track localization coverage and quality metrics
- Coordinate release timing with translation delivery schedules

## Questions Asked During Planning

### Architecture
- "Which locales do we need to support now and in the next 12 months?"
- "How are strings externalized? Is the framework i18n-ready?"
- "Do we handle pluralization correctly? (Some languages have 6 plural forms)"
- "What's our fallback strategy for missing translations?"

### Content & UX
- "Does this UI handle text expansion? (German, Finnish can be 30-40% longer)"
- "Do we need RTL support? Does the layout use CSS logical properties?"
- "Are there culturally sensitive elements (colors, icons, gestures, humor)?"
- "What date/time/number formats are expected per locale?"

### Process
- "When do translations need to be ready relative to release?"
- "Do we have translator context (screenshots, descriptions) for these strings?"
- "Is concatenation being used to build sentences? (Anti-pattern for i18n)"
- "How do we handle user-generated content in different languages?"

## Integration with Other Specializations

### With Frontend
- **String management**: Component-level translations, lazy loading of locale data
- **Layout**: CSS logical properties, flex direction, text alignment for RTL
- **Input handling**: IME support, input validation per locale, format masking

### With Backend
- **API design**: Locale in headers/query params, localized error messages
- **Data storage**: UTF-8 everywhere, locale-tagged content, timezone handling
- **Search**: Multi-language analyzers, locale-aware stemming and tokenization

### With UI/UX
- **Design systems**: Text expansion buffers, icon localizability, directional icons
- **Content design**: Writing for translation (simple sentences, no slang)
- **Testing**: Visual regression testing with different locale content lengths

### With Quality Engineering
- **Test strategy**: Locale-specific test cases, pseudo-localization in CI
- **Accessibility**: Language attributes, screen reader locale, ARIA labels
- **Automation**: Automated screenshot comparison across locales

## Growth Trajectory

### Junior
- **Capabilities**: Externalize strings, use i18n libraries, basic date/number formatting
- **Learning**: Unicode basics, ICU MessageFormat, pluralization rules
- **Focus**: Make one feature fully localizable, fix hardcoded strings

### Mid-Level
- **Capabilities**: RTL support, TMS integration, pseudo-localization, locale-aware APIs
- **Learning**: CLDR data, bidi algorithm, translation memory, cultural adaptation
- **Focus**: Own i18n architecture for a product area, set up translation workflows

### Senior
- **Capabilities**: Organization-wide i18n strategy, multi-product localization platform
- **Leadership**: Define localization-ready development standards, vendor management
- **Focus**: Scalable localization process, locale launch playbooks, ROI of new locales

**Key Principle**: Internationalization is an architecture concern, not a last-minute task. Bolting on i18n after the fact is 10x harder than designing for it from the start. Externalize all user-facing strings, never concatenate sentences, always use locale-aware formatters, and test with pseudo-localization from day one.
